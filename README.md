This project takes asks for initial invesment amount, monthly investment amount, interst rate, and number of years from the user.  
It then prints the yearly balance and interest amount per year without monthly deposit.
Finaly it prints the yearly balance and interest amount per year with monthly deposit.
User can then choose to quit or enter new amounts.

I used a vector of tuples to hold the data calculated from a created account class.  It was challanging coming up with this solution,
but ultimately I feel it was the most efficient way to create and manipulate the data.

If I were to make any changes, I might have a class method that takes a vector as a peramiter and returns the vector with the data.

I feel that using the class and the pointer for the vector gave me experience that will transfer over to future projects.

I made the program readable by clearly commenting my code.  I made it adaptable and maintable by reusing resources to accomplish like tasks.
